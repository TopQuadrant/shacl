Note that constraint components that require validation of nested shapes (such as sh:node) are not implementable without a function such as tosh:hasShape.

DASH is also a SHACL library for frequently needed features and design patterns. All features in this library are 100% standards compliant and will work on any engine that fully supports SHACL.""" ;
